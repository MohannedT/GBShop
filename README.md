Educational application - a mockup of an online store written in Swift. The api is moc-server written in Vapor and deployed on Heroku. 
The layout in the application is done by code. Booting from the network is done using Alamofire. The code is covered by Unit and UI tests. 
Google Analytics connected, Lottie animations used. The application primarily uses collections and tables. Neat code maintained via SwiftLint.
